# Quality Control in Manufacturing Process

1.	Introduction:

The increasing global demand for goods and services has created a highly competitive market, making quality control testing and regulatory compliance across borders more necessary than ever. Manufacturers, regulatory authorities, trade groups, contractors, designers and sales organizations increasingly rely on third-party QA Testers to ensure that the products they receive, specify or use, comply with these requirements. Raw materials testing and samples of products selected during the manufacturing process confirms the quality of the product and allows any necessary changes to be addressed early on. Third-party testing can provide expert advice and guidance or assistance in developing specifications, relieving apprehension and leveraging expertise for quality control in manufacturing.

Manufacturing process:
Manufacturing process is one of the important steps in production process. It mainly concerns with the change of form of material or dimensions of the part being produced. Transportation, handling or storage of parts does not comes under steps of manufacturing process, because these steps are not involved with the change of form of material or dimensions of the part being produced. The geometry of the finished product must have certain tolerances, that it must meet in order to be acceptable and being useful.

Manufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part.

Manufacturing process evaluation:


2.	Data Description:

This is product quality data obtained during the manufacturing process. There are four CSV data files in it: 1) param_data_train, 2) param_data_test, 3) param_data_timevarying_train, and 4) param_data_timevarying_test. Your task is to use the test datasets to predict whether the product quality is good (1) or bad (0).
