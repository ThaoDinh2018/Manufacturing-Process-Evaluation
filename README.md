# Quality Control in Manufacturing Process

1.	Introduction:

With a highly competitive market due to the growth of global demand for goods and services, quality control becomes an essential and crucial part in any production process. To ensure that the products can be produced comply with strict requirements, manufacturers or regulatory authorities increasingly rely on several techniques during manufacturing process. One among of those is quality control products during manufacturing by classifying production outcome based upon input information in order to determine the quality of the product and allows any necessary changes to be addressed early on. To understand more deeply about manufacturing process and how quality control with classification can be applied in, let take a quick look at their definition and explanation.

What is manufacturing process? As a Wiki definition, manufacturing process is defined as “the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part.”

So, how does quality control in manufacturing process with classification work? Specifically, quality control in manufacturing process with classification is a simple approach to detect a good or bad quality of a batch production with historical data from similar previous batch production. These archived information included input raw material, ratio of raw material in use, or material brand names in last production process. The information then will be used  as a training data set to establish a model classifier. For each algorithms or techniques used in creating a classifier, the prediction output may be different. Particularly, in this project, we applied 4 different algorithms for classification. Details of these algorithms will be explained deeper in the next section Algorithms and Techniques. From now, the model classifier will be used in order to predict the quality of current batch production and provide or make appropriate decision for next stage in production process.

2.2	Decision Tree

2.3	Support Vector Machine SVM

3.	Methodology:

3.1	Data description  (step 1)

This is product quality data obtained during the manufacturing process. There are four CSV data files in it: 1) param_data_train, 2) param_data_test, 3) param_data_timevarying_train, and 4) param_data_timevarying_test. Your task is to use the test datasets to predict whether the product quality is good (1) or bad (0).
